<li><a href="C++ Language.html"><font color="red"><h3>C++ Language</h3></font></a></li>
<font size="4">The C++ language has an object-oriented structure that is used in large projects. In each part of the program, programmers may collaborate on one program in separate sections or even on one individual job. The object-oriented framework often allows the code to be reused several times. This language is an effective language. But, a lot of programmers are going to disagree</font>
<li><a href="C Language.html"><font color="red"><h3>C Language</h3></font></a></li>
<font size="4">The C-language is a basic programming language and is a very popular language, particularly used in game programming, because the C-language includes additional C++ packing, this language is used by each programmer because it makes programs faster. However, the importance of this language gives the reusability of C++ to a small increase in C-language efficiency.</font>
<li><a href="Pascal language.html"><font color="red"><h3>Pascal language </h3></font></a></li>
<font size="4">Pascal language is mostly a teaching language, and few industries use this language to write programs. This language tends to use keywords instead of C-language symbols and braces. This language is therefore very easy for beginners to understand than a programming language like C, C++. Borland is a compiler software company that uses Delphi programming language for industrial applications. Delphi is Pascal's object-oriented language, and now Borland compilers only use it.</font>
<li><a href="Fortran language.html"><font color="red"><h3>Fortran language </h3></font></a></li>
<font size="4">Fortran language is a number crunching language and is still used by scientists. This language allows variables of different sizes up to the memory limit of the machine. This language is ideal for engineers who need to measure high-precision values. The program in Fortran is rigid and sometimes difficult to read</font>
<li><a href="Java Language.html"><font color="red"><h3> Java Language </h3></font></a></li>
<font size="4">Java is a multi-platform language that is especially useful for networking. Of course, this language is mostly used on the web with Java applets. However, this language is used to design cross-platform programs, since it is similar to C++ in structure and syntax. For C++ programmers, the Java language is very easy to learn and offers some of the advantages of object-oriented programming. Like reusability, it can be difficult to write efficient code in Java. Nowadays, however, the speed of the Java language has increased and the 1.5 version offers some good features for easy programming.</font>
<li><a href="PHP Language.html"><font color="red"><h3>PHP Language</h3><</font></a></li>
<font size="4">The PHP language is used to design web pages and is sometimes used as a scripting language. This language is designed to develop a fast website and, as a result, includes features that make it easy to generate HTTP headers and link to databases. As a scripting language, it includes a set of components that allow the programmer to get up to speed. However, it has more sophisticated object-oriented features.</font>
